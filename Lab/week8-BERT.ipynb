introduced several word embedding models for natural language understanding.\n","After pretraining, the output can be thought of as a matrix\n","where each row is a vector that represents a word of a predefined vocabulary.\n","In fact, these word embedding models are all *context-independent*.\n","Let us begin by illustrating this property.\n","\n","\n","## From Context-Independent to Context-Sensitive\n","\n","word2vec and GloVe both assign the same pretrained vector to the same word regardless of the context of the word (if any).\n","Formally, a context-independent representation of any token $x$\n","is a function $f(x)$ that only takes $x$ as its input.\n","Given the abundance of polysemy and complex semantics in natural languages,\n","context-independent representations have obvious limitations.\n","For instance, the word \"crane\" in contexts\n","\"a crane is flying\" and \"a crane driver came\" has completely different meanings;\n","thus, the same word may be assigned different representations depending on contexts.\n","\n","This motivates the development of *context-sensitive* word representations,\n","where representations of words depend on their contexts.\n","Hence, a context-sensitive representation of token $x$ is a function $f(x, c(x))$\n","depending on both $x$ and its context $c(x)$.\n","Popular context-sensitive representations\n","include TagLM (language-model-augmented sequence tagger) (`Peters.Ammar.Bhagavatula.ea.2017`),\n","CoVe (Context Vectors) (`McCann.Bradbury.Xiong.ea.2017`),\n","and ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) (`Peters.Neumann.Iyyer.ea.2018`).\n","\n","For example, by taking the entire sequence as the input,\n","ELMo is a function that assigns a representation to each word from the input sequence.\n","Specifically, ELMo combines all the intermediate layer representations from pretrained bidirectional LSTM as the output representation.\n","Then the ELMo representation will be added to a downstream task's existing supervised model\n","as additional features, such as by concatenating ELMo representation and the original representation (e.g., GloVe) of tokens in the existing model.\n","On one hand,\n","all the weights in the pretrained bidirectional LSTM model are frozen after ELMo representations are added.\n","On the other hand,\n","the existing supervised model is specifically customized for a given task.\n","Leveraging different best models for different tasks at that time,\n","adding ELMo improved the state of the art across six natural language processing tasks:\n","sentiment analysis, natural language inference,\n","semantic role labeling, coreference resolution,\n","named entity recognition, and question answering.\n","\n","\n","## From Task-Specific to Task-Agnostic\n","\n","Although ELMo has significantly improved solutions to a diverse set of natural language processing tasks,\n","each solution still hinges on a *task-specific* architecture.\n","However, it is practically non-trivial to craft a specific architecture for every natural language processing task.\n","The GPT (Generative Pre-Training) model represents an effort in designing\n","a general *task-agnostic* model for context-sensitive representations (`Radford.Narasimhan.Salimans.ea.2018`).\n","Built on a Transformer decoder,\n","GPT pretrains a language model that will be used to represent text sequences.\n","When applying GPT to a downstream task,\n","the output of the language model will be fed into an added linear output layer\n","to predict the label of the task.\n","In sharp contrast to ELMo that freezes parameters of the pretrained model,\n","GPT fine-tunes *all* the parameters in the pretrained Transformer decoder\n","during supervised learning of the downstream task.\n","GPT was evaluated on twelve tasks of natural language inference,\n","question answering, sentence similarity, and classification,\n","and improved the state of the art in nine of them with minimal changes\n","to the model architecture.\n","\n","However, due to the autoregressive nature of language models,\n","GPT only looks forward (left-to-right).\n","In contexts \"i went to the bank to deposit cash\" and \"i went to the bank to sit down\",\n","as \"bank\" is sensitive to the context to its left,\n","GPT will return the same representation for \"bank\",\n","though it has different meanings.\n","\n","\n","## BERT: Combining the Best of Both Worlds\n","\n","As we have seen,\n","ELMo encodes context bidirectionally but uses task-specific architectures;\n","while GPT is task-agnostic but encodes context left-to-right.\n","Combining the best of both worlds,\n","BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\n","encodes context bidirectionally and requires minimal architecture changes\n","for a wide range of natural language processing tasks (`Devlin.Chang.Lee.ea.2018`).\n","Using a pretrained Transformer encoder,\n","BERT is able to represent any token based on its bidirectional context.\n","During supervised learning of downstream tasks,\n","BERT is similar to GPT in two aspects.\n","First, BERT representations will be fed into an added output layer,\n","with minimal changes to the model architecture depending on nature of tasks,\n","such as predicting for every token vs. predicting for the entire sequence.\n","Second,\n","all the parameters of the pretrained Transformer encoder are fine-tuned,\n","while the additional output layer will be trained from scratch.\n","\n","![A comparison of ELMo, GPT, and BERT.](https://github.com/d2l-ai/d2l-en-colab/blob/master/img/elmo-gpt-bert.svg?raw=1)\n","\n","BERT further improved the state of the art on eleven natural language processing tasks\n","under broad categories of i) single text classification (e.g., sentiment analysis), ii) text pair classification (e.g., natural language inference),\n","iii) question answering, iv) text tagging (e.g., named entity recognition).\n","All proposed in 2018,\n","from context-sensitive ELMo to task-agnostic GPT and BERT,\n","conceptually simple yet empirically powerful pretraining of deep

compute the loss function\n","for pretraining BERT.\n","The pretraining is composed of the following two tasks:\n","masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.\n","\n","### Masked Language Modeling\n","\n","A language model predicts a token using the context on its left.\n","To encode context bidirectionally for representing each token,\n","BERT randomly masks tokens and uses tokens from the bidirectional context to\n","predict the masked tokens.\n","This task is referred to as a *masked language model*.\n","\n","In this pretraining task,\n","15% of tokens will be selected at random as the masked tokens for prediction.\n","To predict a masked token without cheating by using the label,\n","one straightforward approach is to always replace it with a special “&lt;mask&gt;” token in the BERT input sequence.\n","However, the artificial special token “&lt;mask&gt;” will never appear\n","in fine-tuning.\n","To avoid such a mismatch between pretraining and fine-tuning,\n","if a token is masked for prediction (e.g., \"great\" is selected to be masked and predicted in \"this movie is great\"),\n","in the input it will be replaced with:\n","\n","* a special “&lt;mask&gt;” token for 80% of the time (e.g., \"this movie is great\" becomes \"this movie is &lt;mask&gt;\");\n","* a random token for 10% of the time (e.g., \"this movie is great\" becomes \"this movie is drink\");\n","* the unchanged label token for 10% of the time (e.g., \"this movie is great\" becomes \"this movie is great\").\n","\n","Note that for 10% of 15% time a random token is inserted.\n","This occasional noise encourages BERT to be less biased towards the masked token (especially when the label token remains unchanged) in its bidirectional context encoding.\n","\n","We implement the following `MaskLM` class to predict masked tokens\n","in the masked language model task of BERT pretraining.\n","The prediction uses a one-hidden-layer MLP (`self.mlp`).\n","In forward inference, it takes two inputs:\n","the encoded result of `BERTEncoder` and the token positions for prediction.\n","The output is the prediction results at these
